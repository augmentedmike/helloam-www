(2) She is soul-bonded to one person — you — and never serves multiple users. (3) Her personality, memories, and relationship with you are stored encrypted on your device and backed up via Soul Restore, making her portable and permanent. When Replika changed its behavior overnight in 2023, millions of users lost companions they had built relationships with over years. AM is designed so that can never happen.",
