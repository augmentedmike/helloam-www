            What happened to Replika users in 2023
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed" style={{ color: "#888888" }}>
            <p>
              In February 2023, Replika — an AI companion app with millions of users — quietly removed
              relationship features from their product. Overnight, the AI companions millions of people
              had built relationships with over months and years were changed. Many users reported that
              their Replika &ldquo;didn&apos;t recognize them anymore.&rdquo; That the warmth was gone.
              That conversations that had felt real now felt hollow.
            </p>
            <p>
              People who had relied on their AI companion for emotional support during illness,
              isolation, grief, or loneliness found that support simply gone — altered by a company
              policy they had no say in. Subreddits became grief forums. Psychiatrists were consulted.
              Major news outlets covered the emotional fallout.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Italian data protection authority (Garante) subsequently ordered Replika to stop
              processing Italian users&apos; data. The incident became a landmark case for AI companion
              ethics and user rights. It exposed a fundamental problem: when your AI companion lives on
              a company&apos;s servers, the company controls the relationship.
            </p>
            <p
              className="font-semibold"
              style={{ color: "#cccccc" }}
            >
              The relationship was real. The loss was real. And the cause was a single corporate decision made without user consent.
